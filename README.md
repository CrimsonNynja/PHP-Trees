# PHP-Trees
This repo is designed to have all common trees used in an easy to use php way

currently all that is complete is a binary search tree implementation, however in the future, the will be expanded upon

All tests are written un PHP Unit, and all code is written in the PSR-4 standards




# Future Plans
completion of iterator integration / tree traversal
deleting from the binary tree
custom comparitors for inserting any type
2-3 tree
balanced binary tree
search types (depth first search breadth first search, etc)
